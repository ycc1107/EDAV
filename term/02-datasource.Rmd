## Data Source

These files contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. The file containing loan data through the "present" contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the previous completed calendar quarter. Additional features include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes, and state, and collections among others. 

2260668 rows * 145 columns.
The size of this data is about 2,260,000 x 145. Compare to datasets we have used in Psets 1-4, it's relatively large. We have to bring in some new techniques to handle this dateset.
